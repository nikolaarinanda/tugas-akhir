# Detection of Cyberbullying on Social Media Using the Long Short-Term Memory Method

<!-- This is the short explanation about the title of the project. -->

This research focuses on using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) for classifying cyberbullying in the TikTok comments dataset. In this study, by using LSTM, I improve the accuracy compared to previous [research](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10468424) using same dataset that uses BERT.
